# Terraform + Docker: Provisioning an Nginx Container

## Task 3 - DevOps Internship Assignment

This project demonstrates how to use Terraform to provision a local Docker container running the Nginx web server. The goal was to practice Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by managing Docker resources through Terraform scripts.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Terraform
- Docker
- VS Code (optional)
- Windows 10 with PowerShell

---

## Files and Directory Structure

terraform-docker-nginx/
├── main.tf # Terraform configuration file
├── README.md # Project documentation
├── .terraform/ # Auto-generated by Terraform
├── terraform.tfstate # Terraform state file


---

## Steps I Followed

1. **Installed Terraform**

   Installed using Chocolatey:


---

choco install terraform

2. **Verified Terraform Installation**

terraform -version

3. **Created `main.tf` File**

This file contains configuration for:
- Docker provider
- Pulling the Nginx image
- Creating and running a container

4. **Initialized Terraform**

Ran the following command:

terraform init

5. **Planned the Execution**

To preview what will be created:

terraform plan

6. **Applied the Configuration**

Created the container:


terraform apply

Typed `yes` when prompted.

7. **Verified Container**

Opened Docker Desktop and checked that the Nginx container was running on port 8080.

## Issues Faced and Solutions

| Problem | Solution |
|--------|----------|
| Terraform not recognized | Added it to the system PATH |
| Docker not responding | Restarted Docker Desktop |
| Port 8080 already used | Changed port in `main.tf` |
| Permission denied on Docker socket | Ran terminal as administrator |

---

## Clean Up (Optional)

To destroy the resources:
terraform destroy


---

## How to Push This Project to GitHub


---

## Final Output

- An Nginx container running locally via Docker
- Provisioned entirely through Terraform using declarative configuration
